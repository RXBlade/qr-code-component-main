### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Blood and tears

### What I learned

I learned how to style elements and the most annoying part of CSS CENTERING THINGS.

### Continued development

Next up I will study Tailwind CSS and a little bit of SASS for the design part and I'm planning on using React or Next.js from now on.

### Useful resources

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14676613/how-to-import-google-web-font-in-css-file) - yes, I forgot how to link a font.
[css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-styling-using-attribute-selectors/) I have never used media queries until now.
